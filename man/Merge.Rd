\description{
Merges two or more data frames on the basis of common column names.
}
\usage{
Merge(..., join="outer", fill=0, split=FALSE)
}

\arguments{
  \item{...}{ two or more data frames to merge. }
  \item{join}{ type of join to perform.  Should be an unambiguous abbreviation of either "outer", "inner", or "leftouter". An outer join produces a data frame that contains all the unique column names of the input data, ie, the union of all input column names. An inner join produces a data frame containing only column names that are common across the input data, ie. the intersection of the input column names. A left outer join produces a data frame containing all column names of the first data frame only: column names that occur in subsequent data frames are omitted. }
  \item{fill}{ value to use to fill non-matched columns. Defaults to zero which is appropriate for species abundance data. }
  \item{split}{ logical to return a single data frame (TRUE) or a named list containing separate (original) data frames with a common set of merged columns (FALSE). Defaults to TRUE (a single data frame). }
}

\details{
  \code{Merge} is a utilty function for combining separate datasets of biological count data that have only a subset of taxa (column names) in common.  The outer join is appropriate for merging prior to a joint ordination or for merging a training set and core data prior to environmental reconstruction using the modern analogue technique (MAT).  A left outer join should be used to prepare data for an ordination of a training set and subsequent projection of a second onto the ordination axes. The function is capitalised to distinguish it from \code{merge} in the base R.
}
\value{
If split is set to FALSE the function returns a single data frame with the number of rows equal to the combined rows of the input data and columns sorted alphabetically according to the join type.  Otherwise returns a named list of the merged data frames.
