\title{Diatom stratigraphic data from the Round Loch of Glenhead, Galloway, Southwest Scotland}
\usage{
  data(RLGH)
}
\description{
Diatom stratigraphic data from the Round Loch of Glenhead, Galloway, Southwest Scotland from core K05, first published in Allott et al. (1992) and re-analysed in Juggins et al. (1996) and Battarbee et al. (2005).  Data are relative abundances (percentages) of a subset of 41 diatom taxa in 20 samples, and includes all taxa with a maximum abundance of 1 percent in any core sample. Dataset is a list with the following named elements: \code{spec} diatom relative abundances, \code{depth} associated sediment core depths and 210Pb ages. Column names in \code{RLGH$spec} are short, 6-character alphanumeric codes for each diatom taxon. \code{RLGH$names} contains the full names for each taxon, in the correct order).  Note that some rare and low abundance taxa have been removed so the percentages do not sum to 100.
